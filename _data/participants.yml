My major research interests are product development, which I have been carried out research on plant regulator, fertilizer study/nutritional study, soil amendment, superabsorbent polymer in agricultural, nursery practices and utilization of oil palm by- product. Currently, my focus is on soil amendment and planting media. I have degrees in Major in Biology (Hons) from University Putra Malaysia."
