Building climate change resilience is a global challenge of critical importance to Malaysia. Incorporating climate resilience into initiatives supporting agri-business and rural well-being in Malaysia will require innovative approaches that address cross-cutting issues related to livelihood, such as income and food security, access to services, affordable energy and sustainable agriculture. New digital tools and interdisciplinary approaches provide a potentially game-changing resource in the development of research and policy application that addresses the resilience challenges facing Malaysian communities. Integrating the University of Reading's expertise on climate change, socio-economic welfare and development, with Crops For the Future's expertise on agro-biodiversity and climate resilient cropping systems, the workshop will bring together Early Career Researchers to devise responses to diverse climate resilience challenges in Malaysia that support agri-businesses and rural communities.
